- 👋 Hi, I’m Mohammed Kazmi, a Medical Laboratory Scientist learning programming languages in order to move into the Tech field. Welcome to my Github page!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **Python**, **Ruby**, and **SQL**
- 🎯 Outside the Tech field I am always trying to learn new things and to make old things run smoother, whether that be at work or at home. I like to learn and enjoy anything that I have not done before, I will never knock something before trying it! 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on analytical and coding projects in order to build my skills for the workforce and apply for positions as a data scientist or software engineer.
- 📫 How to reach me: Kazkumail@gmail.com | 1-347-925-8332
